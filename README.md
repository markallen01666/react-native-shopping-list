# react-native-shopping-list

A mobile app shopping list built using React Native 

I built this app as an exercise while learning React Native. The app was built using Expo and Android SDK emulators. This app is developed from my previous React Native app - a To Do list app.

This app adds additional functionality on top of the earlier To Do app, adding modals for data entry and confirmation, differing behaviour on long and short pushes and buttons to trigger modes.
